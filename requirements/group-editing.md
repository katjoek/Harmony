# Membership editing from Groups page
    - There should be two lists:
        - the left one showing people NOT in the current group and
        - the right one showing people that are in the group
    - It must be possible to select multiple persons in either list.
    - Double clicking on an entry should move it to the other list (and change the membership statusses accordingly)
    - The list should support vertical scrolling in case there are more than 10 entries to show.
    - There should be arrow buttons between the two lists (centered vertically between the lists):
        - one for moving selected items to the left (and change the membership statusses accordingly)
        - one for moving selected items to the right (and change the membership statusses accordingly)

# Membership editing from Persons page
    - Similar to "Membership editing from Groups page", there must be a similar UI here. But here, we're selecting groups instead of persons..
